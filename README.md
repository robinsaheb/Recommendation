# Recommendation
Collaborative  ltering is the process of filtering for information or patterns using techniques including collaboration among multiple agents, viewpoints, data sources, and so on. Collaborative filtering methods have been applied to many different kinds of data, including sensing and monitoring data, such as mineral exploration, environmental sensing over large areas or multiple sensors;  nancial data, such as  nancial service institutions that integrate many financial sources; or in electronic commerce and web applications where the focus is on user data and so on.
The basic principle behind the collaborative filtering approach is that it tries to and people who are similar to each other by looking at their tastes. Let's say if a person primarily likes action movies, then it will try to  nd a person who has seen similar kinds of movies and it will try to recommend the one that hasn't been seen by the first person, but seen by the second person.

User-based collaborative filtering  nds the similarities between users, and then using these similarities between users, a recommendation is made.
Item-based collaborative filtering  nds the similarities between items. This is then used to and new recommendations for a user.
